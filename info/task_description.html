    We are going build ideal robocity, where all buildings will be rectangular and
    streets are laid along south-north and east-west lines.
    First we need a representation for building and in this mission we will
    create class for this.
</p>

<p>
    Because all building are rectangular and walls are parallels to streets
    we can define any building by coordinates of North-West corner as two arguments,
    size from west to east edge,
    size from north to south wall and height of the building.
    These values are described as numbers (conventional units).
    And we need couple operations.
    Father you can see class description.
    You should realize this.
</p>

<p>
    <em>class</em> <strong>Building</strong><em>(north, west, width_WE, width_NS, height=10)</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a new Building instance with North-West corner at [<em>north</em>, <em>west</em>]
    coordinates, size is <em>width_WE</em> by <em>width_NS</em>
    and the height of the building is <em>height</em>.
    "height" is a positive number with default value is 10.
</p>

<pre class="example">
>>> Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
Building at [10, 10]. Size 1 by 2. Height 2.
>>> Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546)
Building at [0, 0]. Size 10.5 by 2.546. Height 10.
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>corners</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a dictionary with coordinates of the building corners. The dictionary has
    next keys: "north-west", "north-east", "south-west", "south-east". The values are
    tuples with two numbers.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building(1, 2, 2, 2).corners()
{"north-west": (1, 2), "north-east": (1, 4), "south-west": (3, 2), "south-east": (3, 4)}
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>area</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns the area of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25).area()
5.25
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>volume</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns the volume of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25, 101).volume()
530.25
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>__str__</strong>()<br>
    <strong>__repr__</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    String representation of the Building. This method is using for "print" or "str" conversation.
    Returns the string in the next view:<br>
    "Building at [{north}, {west}]. Size {width_we}, {width_ns}]. Height {height}."<br>
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> str(Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546))
"Building at [0, 0]. Size 10.5 by 2.546. Height 10."
</pre>

    In this mission all data will be correct and you don't need to implement a type and values checking.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Statements and expression on Building class.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The behaviour as it was described.

<strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Here you will learn how to write a simple class with minimal functionality.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong>
    All data are correct.
