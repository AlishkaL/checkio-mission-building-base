    We are going build ideal robocity, where all buildings will be rectangular and
    streets are laid along south-north and east-west lines.
    First we need a representation for building and in this mission we will
    create class for this.
</p>

<p>
    Because all building are rectangular and walls are parallels to streets
    we can define any building by coordinates of North-West and South-East corners
    and height of the building. These values are described as positive numbers (conventional units).
    And we need couple operations. The zero point of the grid is placed in the Notrh-West.
    Father you can see class description.
    You should realize this.

<p>
    <em>class</em> <strong>Building</strong><em>(north_west, south_east, height=10)</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a new Building instance with North-West corner at "north_west", South-East corner at
    "south_east"
    and the height of the building is "height".
    "north_west" and "south_east" coordinates should be a tuple or a list of two positive number.
    "height" is a positive number with default value is 10.
</p>

<pre class="example">
>>> Building((10, 10), (11, 11), 2)
Building from [10, 10] to [11, 11]. Height 2.
>>> Building((0, 0), (10.5, 2.546))
Building from [0, 0] to [10.5, 2.546]. Height 10.
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>corners</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns a dictionary with coordinates of the building corners. The dictionary has
    next keys: "north-west", "north-east", "south-west", "south-east". The values are
    tuples with two numbers.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building((1, 2), (3, 4)).corners()
{"north-west": (1, 2), "north-east": (1, 4), "south-west": (3, 2), "south-east": (3, 4)}
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>area</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns the area of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building((1, 2.5), (4.5, 4)).area()
5.25
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>volume</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    Returns the volume of the building.
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> Building((1, 2.5), (4.5, 4), 101).volume()
530.25
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>__str__</strong>()<br>
    <strong>__repr__</strong>()
</p>
<p class="indent">
    String representation of the Building. This method is using for "print" or "str" convertation.
    Returns the string in the next view:<br>
    "Building from [{N}, {W}] to [{S}, {E}]. Height {H}."<br>
</p>
<pre class="example">
>>> str(Building((1, 2), (3.3, 44)))
"Building from [1, 2] to [3.3, 44]. Height 10."
</pre>

    In this mission all data will be correct and you don't need to implement a type and values checking.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Statements and expression on Building class.
